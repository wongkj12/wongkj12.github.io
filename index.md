Hi, I'm Kai Jie, a 19 year-old from Singapore currently serving National Service.

In my free time, I enjoy programming (mostly useless) things. Occasionally, I also try writing about cool mathematics on my math blog, [Rambling Maths](https://ramblingmaths.wordpress.com/).

Here are some of my personal projects! [Github](https://github.com/wongkj12)
