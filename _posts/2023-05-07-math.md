**The master theorem**

Let $$a \geq 1, b > 1$$ be constants, and define $$T(n)$$ as such:

$$
T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n),
$$

then
1. If $$f(n) = O(n^{\log_b a - \epsilon})$$ for some $$\epsilon > 0$$, then $$T(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_b a})$$.
2. If $$f(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_b a})$$, then $$T(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_b a} \log n)$$.
3. If $$f(n) = \Omega(n^{\log_b a + \epsilon})$$ for some $$\epsilon > 0$$, and if $$af(n/b) \leq cf(n)$$
for some $$c < 1$$ and all sufficiently large $$n$$, then $$T(n) = \Theta(f(n))$$.

The $$n^\epsilon$$ or $$n^{-\epsilon}$$ term determines whether $$f$$ is *polynomially* faster/slower than $$n^{\log_b a}$$.
Note that
* The 3 cases do not cover all possibilities for $$f$$.
* We do not care whether $$n/b$$ is an integer, as replacement with $$\lfloor n/b \rfloor$$ or $$\lceil n/b \rceil$$ does not affect the asymptotic behaviour.
* In case 3, the regularity condition "$$af(n/b) \leq cf(n)$$ for some $$c<1$$ and all sufficiently large $$n$$" is actually sufficient, i.e. it implies $$f(n) = \Omega(n^{\log_b a + \epsilon})$$. (Can be proven by induction)

**Example**

$$ T(n) = 2T(n/4) + n \log n $$

We have $$a=2,b=4,f(n)=n\log n$$, and $$n^{\log_b a}=n^{\log_4 2}=n^{0.5}$$.
Since $$f(n) = \Omega(n) = \Omega(n^{0.5+\epsilon})$$, we can take $$\epsilon=0.5$$.
For sufficiently large $$n$$, we have that $$af(n/b)=2(n/4)\log(n/4) \leq (n/2)\log(n) = cf(n)$$ 
for $$c=1/2$$. Thus by case 3, $$T(n) = \Theta(n\log n)$$.

**Some intuition?**

When we only look at $$f$$ defined on exact powers of $$b$$, expanding the recurrence we get 

$$T(n) = \Theta(n^{log_b a}) + \sum_{j=0}^{\log_b n - 1} a^j f(n/{b^{j}}).$$

Then $$f$$ being polynomially faster/slower than $$n^{log_b a}$$ determines whether the sum term on the right dominates 
the big-$$\Theta$$ expression.
