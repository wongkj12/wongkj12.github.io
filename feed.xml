<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Exercise C.4-9</strong></p>

  <p>Let \(X\) be the random variable for the total number of successes in a set \(A\) of \(n\) Bernoulli trials, where the \(i\)th trial has a probability \(p_i\) of success, and let \(X'\) be the random variable for the total number of successes in a second set \(A'\) of \(n\) Bernoulli trials, where the \(i\)th trial has a probability \(p_i' \geq p_i\) of success. Prove that for \(0\leq k\leq n\),</p>

  <p>\(P(X'\geq k) \geq P(X\geq k)\).</p>

  <p>(<em>Hint:</em> Show how to obtain the Bernoulli trials in \(A'\) by an experiment involving the trials of \(A\), and use the result of Exercise C.3-7.)</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>I found this exercise interesting as the result is intuitive, but it’s tricky to find a way to “compare” the distributions, as per the hint.</p>

<p>This is one clever solution I found online, which seems obvious in hindsight:</p>

<p>Consider comparing each Bernoulli trial to picking a random value \(S\) on the unit interval. If \(S \leq p_i\), we can call that a success in set \(A\). If \(S \leq p_i'\), we can call that a success in set \(A'\). If \(S \leq p_i\), then \(S \leq p_i'\). Then clearly, whenever there is a success for set \(A\), there must be a success for set \(A'\). So \(X' \geq X\), and \(P(X' \geq k) \geq P(X \geq k)\).</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="notes" /><category term="clrs" /><category term="math" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[On comparing sums of Bernoulli trials]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">CLRS Appendix B: Tree problems</title><link href="https://wongkj12.github.io/blog/2023/treeproblems/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CLRS Appendix B: Tree problems" /><published>2023-06-29T16:20:48+00:00</published><updated>2023-06-29T16:20:48+00:00</updated><id>https://wongkj12.github.io/blog/2023/treeproblems</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://wongkj12.github.io/blog/2023/treeproblems/"><![CDATA[<p>Here are three problems on trees from Appendix B.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Exercise B.5-3</strong></p>

  <p>Show that the number of degree-2 nodes in any nonempty binary tree is 1 fewer than the number of leaves. Conclude that the number of internal nodes in a full binary tree is 1 fewer than the number of leaves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that in the context of a binary tree, the “degree-2” nodes refer to nodes with exactly 2 <em>children</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Proof by strong induction</strong>: Let the number of degree-2 nodes in any tree by \(D\), and the number of leaves be \(L\). Let the number of nodes in a tree be \(n\). Clearly, \(D=L-1\) when \(n=1\). Suppose it is true for all trees with \(\leq n\) nodes. Consider the root of a tree with \(n+1\) nodes. Letting subscripts \(l\) and \(r\) denote the left and right subtrees, we have that</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
D &amp;= D_l + D_r + 1 \\
&amp;= (L_l + L_r - 2) + 1 \\
&amp;= (L_l + L_r) - 1 \\
&amp;= L - 1.
\end{aligned}\]

<p>In a full binary tree, all internal nodes are of degree-2.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Exercise B.5-6</strong></p>

  <p>Let us associate a “weight” \(w(x)=2^{-d}\) with each leaf \(x\) of depth \(d\) in a binary tree \(T\), and let \(L\) be the set of leaves on \(T\). Prove that \(\sum_{x\in L} w(x) \leq 1.\) (This is known as the <strong>Kraft inequality</strong>.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Proof by strong induction</strong>: Let the number of nodes in any tree \(T\) be \(n\). Clearly when \(n=1\), \(\sum_{x\in L}w(x) = 2^0 \leq 1.\) Suppose \(\sum_{x\in L}w(x) \leq 1\) for all trees with \(\leq n\) nodes. Consider the root of a tree \(T\) with \(n+1\) nodes. Notice that the depth of all leaves in the left and right subtrees increase by 1 relative to the root. Similarly letting subscripts \(l\) and \(r\) denote the left and right subtrees, we have that</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\sum_{x\in L}w(x) &amp;= \frac{1}{2}\sum_{x\in L_l}w(x) + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{x\in L_r}w(x) \\
&amp;\leq \frac{1}{2}(1) + \frac{1}{2}(1) \\
&amp;\leq 1.
\end{aligned}\]

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Exercise B.5-7</strong></p>

  <p>Show that if \(L\geq 2\), then every binary tree with \(L\) leaves contains a subtree having between \(L/3\) and \(2L/3\) leaves, inclusive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Proof by contradiction</strong>: Suppose that there is a binary tree with \(L\) leaves, with no subtrees having between \(L/3\) and \(2L/3\) leaves. If \(L\geq 2\), then the root of this tree cannot be a leaf. Take the path \(x_0 = root, x_1, \ldots , x_k\) on the tree down to a leaf, at each step picking the child subtree with the larger number of leaves. Consider the number of leaves of the subtree rooted at each \(x_i\). Clearly the number of leaves is a decreasing sequence, so along the path the number of leaves must decrement from \(x_i\) with more than \(2L/3\) leaves to \(x_{i+1}\) with less than \(L/3\) leaves. However, if \(x_i\) has less than \(L/3\) leaves, then \(x_{i+1}\) must have had less than \(2L/3\) leaves, a contradiction.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="notes" /><category term="clrs" /><category term="math" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Three tree problems from Appendix B]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">CLRS Appendix B: Equivalent conditions for trees</title><link href="https://wongkj12.github.io/blog/2023/trees/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CLRS Appendix B: Equivalent conditions for trees" /><published>2023-06-26T16:01:20+00:00</published><updated>2023-06-26T16:01:20+00:00</updated><id>https://wongkj12.github.io/blog/2023/trees</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://wongkj12.github.io/blog/2023/trees/"><![CDATA[<p>A <em>tree</em> is a connected, acyclic (undirected) graph. Let \(G = (V,E)\) be an undirected graph. Here are some equivalent conditions for \(G\) to be a tree:</p>

<ol>
  <li>\(G\) is a tree.</li>
  <li>Any two vertices in \(G\) are connected by a unique simple path.</li>
  <li>\(G\) is connected, but if any edge is removed from \(E\), the resulting graph is disconnected.</li>
  <li>\(G\) is connected, and \(\lvert E\rvert= \lvert V\rvert-1\).</li>
  <li>\(G\) is acyclic, and \(\lvert E\rvert = \lvert V\rvert-1\).</li>
  <li>\(G\) is acyclic, but if any edge is added to \(E\), the resulting graph contains a cycle.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>I will roughly prove their equivalence here.</p>

<p>\((1) \Rightarrow (2)\):
Since \(G\) is connected, any two vertices \(u, v\) are connected by at least one simple path. If there exists more than one such path between \(u\) and \(v\), then \(G\) contains a cycle (Contradiction).</p>

<p>\((2) \Rightarrow (3)\):
Suppose we remove edge \((u,v)\). If there still exists a path between \(u\) and \(v\), then there would have more than one simple path connecting \(u\) and \(v\) initially (Contadiction). Thus \(u\) and \(v\) must not be connected after the removal of \((u,v)\) so the resulting graph is disconnected.</p>

<p>\((3) \Rightarrow (4)\):
Prove by strong induction (see (A) below).</p>

<p>\((4) \Rightarrow (5)\):
Suppose \(G\) contains cycles. Remove edges from cycles in \(G\) until we get an acyclic graph \(G'=(E',V')\). Note that \(G'\) is still connected, so \(\lvert E'\rvert \geq \lvert V'\rvert - 1\). However, \(\lvert E\rvert = \lvert V\rvert -1\), so this implies we have removed 0 edges! Thus \(G\) must have been acyclic$$.</p>

<p>\((5) \Rightarrow (6)\):
See (B) below.</p>

<p>\((6) \Rightarrow (1)\):
Suppose there is no path connecting \(u\) and \(v\) in \(G\). Then add the edge \((u,v)\) to \(G\). This new edge cannot have formed a cycle (Contradiction). Thus \(G\) must have been connected initially.</p>

<hr />

<p>Additionally, here are two more useful facts: (can be proven via strong induction)</p>

<p>A. \(G\) is connected \(\Rightarrow \lvert E\rvert \geq \lvert V\rvert-1\).</p>

<p>B. \(G\) is acyclic \(\Rightarrow  \lvert E\rvert \leq \lvert V\rvert-1\).</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="notes" /><category term="clrs" /><category term="math" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[On trees]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">CLRS Appendix C: Some probability and bounds</title><link href="https://wongkj12.github.io/blog/2023/probability/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CLRS Appendix C: Some probability and bounds" /><published>2023-05-08T16:03:50+00:00</published><updated>2023-05-08T16:03:50+00:00</updated><id>https://wongkj12.github.io/blog/2023/probability</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://wongkj12.github.io/blog/2023/probability/"><![CDATA[<p>An interesting problem (simulating an unbiased coin given a biased one):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Exercise 5.1-3 (rephrased)</strong></p>

  <p>Suppose you want to output 0 with probability 1/2 and 1 with probability 1/2.
You have a biased function \(R\) which outputs 1 with probability \(p\), and 0 with probability
\(1-p\), where \(0 &lt; p &lt; 1\). Give an algorithm which uses \(R\) to output
an unbiased answer. What is the expected running time?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Call \(R\) twice and store the results in variables \(x\) and \(y\). Note that since \(x\) and \(y\)
are independent and have the same distribution, by symmetry, \(P(x &lt; y) = P(x &gt; y)\), so we just output 1 whenever
\(x &gt; y\), 0 if \(x &lt; y\), and repeat otherwise. The probability of termination in one iteration is constant, equal to
\(P(x \neq y) = 2p(1-p)\), so the number of iterations until termination follows a geometric distribution. Thus in expectation,
the number of iterations will be \(\frac{1}{2p(1-p)}\).</p>

<hr />

<p>While I learn probability, here I’ll list some interesting bounds/formulas from Appendix C:</p>

<p><strong>Stirling’s approximation (3.18)</strong></p>

\[n! = \sqrt{2\pi n}\left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n (1+\Theta(1/n)).\]

<p><strong>Binomial bounds</strong></p>

\[{n\choose k} = \left(\frac{n}{k}\right)\left(\frac{n-1}{k-1}\right)\cdots\left(\frac{n-k+1}{1}\right) \geq \left(\frac{n}{k}\right)^k.\]

\[{n\choose k} \leq \frac{n^k}{k!} \leq \left(\frac{en}{k}\right)^k.\]

\[{n\choose k} \leq \frac{n^n}{k^k (n-k)^{n-k}}.\]

<p><strong>Boole’s inequality/Union bound</strong></p>

\[P\left(\bigcup_i A_i\right) \leq \sum_i P(A_i).\]

<p><strong>Jensen’s inequality (Probabilistic form)</strong></p>

<p>If \(X\) is a random variable and \(f\) is a <em>convex</em> function (i.e. for all \(x,y\) and all \(0 \leq \lambda \leq 1\), we have
\(f(\lambda x + (1-\lambda)y) \leq \lambda f(x) + (1-\lambda)f(y)\)), then</p>

\[\mathbb{E}(f(X)) \geq f(\mathbb{E}(X)),\]

<p>provided that the expectations exist and are finite.</p>

<p><strong>Markov’s inequality (Exercise C.3-6)</strong></p>

<p>Let X be a nonnegative random variable, and suppose that \(\mathbb{E}(X)\) is well-defined. Then</p>

\[P(X\geq t) \leq \mathbb{E}(X)/t\]

<p>for all \(t&gt;0\). To see this note that</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{E}(X) &amp;= \int_{0}^{\infty} xP(X=x)\, dx \\
&amp;= \int_{0}^{t} xP(X=x)\, dx + \int_{t}^{\infty} xP(X=x)\, dx \\
&amp;\geq \int_{t}^{\infty} xP(X=x)\, dx \\
&amp;\geq \int_{t}^{\infty} tP(X=x)\, dx \\
&amp;\geq t\int_{t}^{\infty} P(X=x)\, dx \\
&amp;\geq tP(X&gt;t).

<p>Let \(a \geq 1, b &gt; 1\) be constants, and define \(T(n)\) as such:</p>

\[T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n),\]

<p>then</p>
<ol>
  <li>If \(f(n) = O(n^{\log_b a - \epsilon})\) for some \(\epsilon &gt; 0\), then \(T(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_b a})\).</li>
  <li>If \(f(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_b a})\), then \(T(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_b a} \log n)\).</li>
  <li>If \(f(n) = \Omega(n^{\log_b a + \epsilon})\) for some \(\epsilon &gt; 0\), and if \(af(n/b) \leq cf(n)\)
for some \(c &lt; 1\) and all sufficiently large \(n\), then \(T(n) = \Theta(f(n))\).</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>The \(n^\epsilon\) or \(n^{-\epsilon}\) term determines whether \(f\) is <em>polynomially</em> faster/slower than \(n^{\log_b a}\).
Note that</p>
<ul>
  <li>The 3 cases do not cover all possibilities for \(f\).</li>
  <li>We do not care whether \(n/b\) is an integer, as replacement with \(\lfloor n/b \rfloor\) or \(\lceil n/b \rceil\) does not affect the asymptotic behaviour.</li>
  <li>In case 3, the regularity condition “\(af(n/b) \leq cf(n)\) for some \(c&lt;1\) and all sufficiently large \(n\)” is actually sufficient, i.e. it implies \(f(n) = \Omega(n^{\log_b a + \epsilon})\). (Can be proven by induction)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

\[T(n) = 2T(n/4) + n \log n\]

<p>We have \(a=2,b=4,f(n)=n\log n\), and \(n^{\log_b a}=n^{\log_4 2}=n^{0.5}\).
Since \(f(n) = \Omega(n) = \Omega(n^{0.5+\epsilon})\), we can take \(\epsilon=0.5\).
For sufficiently large \(n\), we have that \(af(n/b)=2(n/4)\log(n/4) \leq (n/2)\log(n) = cf(n)\) 
for \(c=1/2\). Thus by case 3, \(T(n) = \Theta(n\log n)\).</p>

<p><strong>Some intuition?</strong></p>

<p>When we only look at \(f\) defined on exact powers of \(b\), expanding the recurrence we get</p>

\[T(n) = \Theta(n^{log_b a}) + \sum_{j=0}^{\log_b n - 1} a^j f(n/{b^{j}}).\]

<p>The term on the left is the sum of the leaves of the recurrence tree, and the sum term on the right represents the sum of the remaining nodes. 
Then \(f\) being polynomially faster/slower than \(n^{log_b a}\) determines whether the sum term on the right dominates the big-\(\Theta\) expression.</p>

<p><strong>On the regularity condition in case 3</strong>: When you draw the recursion tree, \(af(n/b) \leq cf(n)\) for some \(c&lt;1\) implies
that the root node is always greater than the sum of its’ children, i.e. work done at every level decreases by a factor of \(c\).
Summing over all the levels, we get an upper bound of something like \(f(n) + cf(n) + c^2 f(n) + ... = f(n)(\frac{1}{1-c})\)
(converges since \(c &lt; 1\)). Then \(f(n) = \Omega(n^{\log_b a + \epsilon})\) dominates the big-\(\Theta\) expression.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="notes" /><category term="clrs" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overview on the master theorem]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">MA2202 Cheatsheet</title><link href="https://wongkj12.github.io/blog/2023/ma2202/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="MA2202 Cheatsheet" /><published>2023-05-06T16:02:50+00:00</published><updated>2023-05-06T16:02:50+00:00</updated><id>https://wongkj12.github.io/blog/2023/ma2202</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://wongkj12.github.io/blog/2023/ma2202/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="notes" /><category term="math" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cheatsheet for MA2202 (Algebra I) 22/23 Sem 2]]></summary></entry></feed>
